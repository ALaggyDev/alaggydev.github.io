# Laggy's Blog

A blog for CTF write-ups, gists and random stuff I made on the Internet.

This blog uses the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Building

Install Ruby and Jekyll in [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/).

Folders of interest: `/_posts`, `/_tabs`.

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```
