Hello! I am Jimmy, also known as Laggy. I love computers, coding & CTF :) 

## LiveOverflow Minecraft Server Journey

I have watched [LiveOverflow](https://www.youtube.com/@LiveOverflow)'s videos for a long time. In 2022-2023, I played on his Minecraft CTF server ([playlist](engineering)), and it's super fun for a computer nerd like me :)

In order to even join the server, you are supposed to scan the entire Internet for all IPs that host a Minecraft server, and find his server IP. (See [here](https://youtu.be/QradKmQ27JY?list=PLhixgUqwRTjwvBI-hmbZ2rpkAl4lutnJG&t=1246) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoS0PM20KJk) for more details) (I did not, of course)

Later, you need to write special bypasses for your Minecraft client to continue playing ([here](https://youtu.be/WEMOCFe4EFE?list=PLhixgUqwRTjwvBI-hmbZ2rpkAl4lutnJG&t=609)).

I also managed to find the coordinates of his new base within a day ([here](https://youtu.be/V4_5x4QtHVg?list=PLhixgUqwRTjwvBI-hmbZ2rpkAl4lutnJG&t=11)), and did some goofy things in the server.

He also made lots of _challenges_, where you have to read the Minecraft source code and write a exploit in your Minecraft client. I solved all of those.

## My CTF Journey

> CTF stands for __Capture The Flag__. It is a type of cybersecurity competition in which participants attempt to find or gather "flags", which are secretly hidden in purposefully vulnerable programs or websites. It is used to test and develop computer security skills, such as __cryptography__, __reverse engineering__ and __binary exploitation__.

I got into CTF because of LiveOverflow's videos.

A long time ago, I played wargames in [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/). In 2024, I started playing [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) and [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/). I don't know why, but I really enjoyed learning about cryptography, reverse engineering, binary exploitation, web exploitation etc.
