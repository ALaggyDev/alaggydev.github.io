Most of my projects are not good enough to be worthy of displaying. Nevertheless, here are some of my somewhat noteworthly projects:
- This blog!
- A [automatic puzzle solver](https://github.com/ALaggyDev/logic-grid-solver) for the game _Islands of Insight_. It eventually got merged into [Logic Pad](https://github.com/hlysine/logic-pad).
- [ncr_rs](https://github.com/ALaggyDev/ncr-rs), a Rust crate to implement Minecraft's No Chat Reports (NCR) chat encryption.
- [Prism lang](https://github.com/ALaggyDev/prism-lang), a small toy programming language written in Rust. (still incomplete)

Here are some "projects" that may be interesting:
- [Advent of Code 2024](https://github.com/ALaggyDev/advent-of-code-2024) _(full 25 days with leaderboard!)_
- [My CTF Repository](https://github.com/ALaggyDev/CTF-Competitions)
